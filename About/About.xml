	<description>A set of minor fixes, tweaks, and changes to the game.  While many of these ARE "fixes," they oh-so-slightly slow the game and probably don't add a whole lot more than a little realism (e.g., smelters giving off heat).  Some of them make the game slightly harder, some make the game much easier to play.  I like all of them (otherwise, I wouldn't have made them, right?)

I have added mod settings that allow turning off most of the changes.  IMPORTANT NOTE: you will have to restart the game to make these changes take place.

Current changes:

More "realism":
 * Smelters give off heat
 * Computers (hi-tech research benches) give off heat
 ** (maybe later they will fry if the heat gets too much)

UI:
 * If you have selected a blueprint, and it gets built, you now have selected the finished item.  Huzzah!

QoL / Ease of Use:
 * Penoxycyline now defaults to being taken every 5 days
 * Weddings now only start with user permission.

Fixes / Improvements:
 * "Spots" can now be placed pretty much anywhere, including under other things.  Want to get married sitting on thrones or standing in a river?  Go for it.  Want to party around lava?  Have fun (lava not included).
 ** Party Spots may or may not work outside (they certainly don't in terrible weather), but they now work under objects...heck even under some walls.  Use discretion.
 * Multilpe colonists can unload the same animal (sort of)
